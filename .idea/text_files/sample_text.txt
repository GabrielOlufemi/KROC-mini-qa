Lancey Foux, born Omal on November 30, 1995, is a British rapper, singer, and songwriter from Stratford, East London. He is widely known for his experimental approach to rap and his ability to blend trap, punk, and electronic influences into a sound that feels both futuristic and unpredictable. He began his music career in 2015 with the release of his debut project *Pink*, which immediately introduced audiences to his unique style and creative energy. That same year, he followed up with *TEEN SKUM*, and by 2017 he was already showing his versatility with the collaborative tape *First Day at Nursery* alongside producer Nyge. These early projects helped him build a foundation and earn recognition in the UK underground scene.

As his artistry developed, Lancey began releasing more polished and daring projects. In 2018, he dropped *Too Far Alive*, and later that year he released *Pink II*, which featured the track “Dyed 2WICE” with Skepta, marking a key moment of collaboration with one of the UK’s most respected rappers. The following year, he delivered *Friend or Foux*, an album that further established him as a standout in the UK rap scene, followed by *FIRST DEGREE* in 2021. His creativity didn’t stop there; in the same year, he also released *LIVE.EVIL*. In 2022, he unveiled *Life in Hell*, a project many fans consider his magnum opus because of its ambitious range and versatility. He continued his momentum with *BACK2DATRAP* in 2023 and *CONGLOMERATE* in 2024, both of which showed his constant evolution as an artist who never settles for repetition.

Throughout his career, Lancey Foux has released several songs that highlight different sides of his artistry. One of his early breakthrough singles was “About It,” which gained attention for its clever interpolation of Ginuwine’s “Pony.” Tracks like “Dyed 2WICE” featuring Skepta and “India” from *Friend or Foux* stand as fan favorites, while songs such as “Lancey or Lancey” and “Cooler Than Me” showcase his ability to make catchy yet unconventional rap records. In more recent years, singles like “Daylight” featuring Teezo Touchdown and Cash Cobain, “Gotta Get U,” “Live Forever,” and “On Ur Mind” have reflected his experimental edge and international appeal. In 2025, he released the double single “Enter The Dragon” and “TEKTIME” featuring BNYX®, as well as “Female Top,” all of which further expand his growing catalog.

His collaborations and performances add another layer to his legacy. He has appeared on songs like “Waves” with Killa Ki and has a history of electrifying live performances, where tracks such as “OUTTAMYMIND!,” “25WAGG3DOU2,” “RESPECT,” and “India” frequently appear on his setlists. Fans also celebrate deeper cuts like “Life & Death,” “Thank You,” “Wake Up/I’m Alive,” “Casino Royale,” and “Luvs Killing Me Slowly” as some of his most essential work, proving that his music resonates both on the surface with popular hits and beneath it with emotional, introspective tracks.

Beyond music, Lancey Foux has made a mark through his bold and eccentric fashion sense, often collaborating with designers and brands that align with his futuristic image. This blending of music and style has made him more than just a rapper; he has become a cultural tastemaker whose influence extends into lifestyle and fashion. His rise reflects the new wave of UK rap, where individuality and experimentation are valued just as much as lyrical ability and production. Constantly reinventing himself while staying authentic to his vision, Lancey Foux continues to stand out as one of the most distinctive and innovative voices in the UK and global rap scenes.
